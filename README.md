# Torquay Sunday League

MAIN IMAGE

This is a Django web application for Ascension, a music studio based in Birmingham. Languages used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, created using <!-- list -->.

Thie project allows users to book studio time with engineers or rehearsal rooms for practicing musicians/bands. It also has a small shop which is situated in the foyer, where musicians can buy strings, capos, and other small instrument parts.

The web application allows the creator to create more listings in the products section, and more studios, sound engineers and rehearsal rooms.

## Deployment

<!-- To deploy my first Heroku project, I followed the steps set by Code Institute.

- Create an account on ElephantSQL
- Create new instance and copy database URL
- Create a Procfile and requirements.txt file
- Add an if statement to ensure SQLAlchemy can read my external database.
- Create new app on Heroku
- Enter config vars, including the copied URL
- Click on deploy, connect to github, find the repository
- Click Deploy Branch
- Once that is done, click more, and run console.

It was importing the database from torquay_sunday_league that first provided issues.

My requirements.txt hadn't created an instance for the 'requests' module which needed to be installed. I checked the version I had and provided it in the file.

- I tried again and it worked, after this I opened the app and entered the teams data into the database. -->

## UX

### Project Goal

To allow users to book sessions in either the studio and/or the rehearsal rooms, whilst also giving them the option to order small parts from a small online store.

#### Business and Developer Goals

### Design Choices

The website needs to look professional and high tech, we want customers to feel like this is a high end studio that knows their craft. We want thea dark blue environment associated with being in a studio, I'm going for electric blue to stay relative, with sharp edges.
