# Ascension

MAIN IMAGE

This is a Django web application for Ascension, a music studio based in Birmingham. Languages used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, created using <!-- list -->.

Thie project allows users to book studio time with engineers or rehearsal rooms for practicing musicians/bands. It also has a small shop which is situated in the foyer, where musicians can buy strings, capos, and other small instrument parts.

The web application allows the creator to create more listings in the products section, and more studios, sound engineers and rehearsal rooms.

## Deployment

<!-- To deploy my first Heroku project, I followed the steps set by Code Institute.

- Create an account on ElephantSQL
- Create new instance and copy database URL
- Create a Procfile and requirements.txt file
- Add an if statement to ensure SQLAlchemy can read my external database.
- Create new app on Heroku
- Enter config vars, including the copied URL
- Click on deploy, connect to github, find the repository
- Click Deploy Branch
- Once that is done, click more, and run console.

It was importing the database from torquay_sunday_league that first provided issues.

My requirements.txt hadn't created an instance for the 'requests' module which needed to be installed. I checked the version I had and provided it in the file.

- I tried again and it worked, after this I opened the app and entered the teams data into the database. -->

## UX

### Project Goal

To allow users to book sessions in either the studio and/or the rehearsal rooms, whilst also giving them the option to order small parts from a small online store.

#### Business and Developer Goals

As the business owner I want users to believe in both our studio's and engineer's capabilities. I want the site to look "record label level" professional. I want users to be able to easily navigate through the three main site pages and be drawn in by the use of imagery and ease of use. I want them to be able to purchase or hire easily, and for bookings and stock to change when this happens.

I also need to be able to add, change and delete items myself.

- To create a site that has user authentication.
- To create a site that updates when products are bought/hired.
- To promote a professional looking studio and capable engineers.
- To have a site with complete ease of use.
- To have complete CRUD functionality over the products I am offering.

### Design Choices

The website needs to look professional and high tech, we want customers to feel like this is a high end studio that knows their craft. We want thea dark blue environment associated with being in a studio, I'm going for electric blue to stay relative, with sharp edges.

### Competitor Review

What other music studios are there in Birmingham?

#### The Oxygen Rooms

The [Oxygen Rooms](https://theoxygenrooms.com/) are a studio located on Barr St in Hockley, on the edge of Birmingham City Centre.

Pro's

- The website is very professional, showcasing fantastic equipment in it's images.

- The header and footer makes the site easy to navigate.

- The contact info is reasonably sized, responsive and informative.

Con's

- The first thing I noticed is there is no favicon, seems like a small issue but this it what also appers on google search, which looks like an illegitimate site.

- Then I noticed the colour scheme throughout the site. All of it is black and white. Although this does look professional it's limiting itself on how welcoming it can be and how it could stand out with colour.

- There is a div on the rehearsals page that doesn't resize with the text, meaning at certain sizes some of the text isn't visible.

<img src="/media/readme-images/oxygen-con.png" width="50%" alt="Homepage Wireframe" style="display: inherit; ">

- The socials link in the navbar doesn't list socials, but instead takes the user to Instagram without any indication that it is about to do so. The user is no longer on the Oxygen Rooms website.

- You cannot book or hire online at all.

- There is no information about the engineers provided.

#### Pirate.com

[Pirate Studios](https://pirate.com/en/locations/birmingham/) is located on Upper Trinity St in Birmingham.

Pro's

- There are lots of welcoming videos and images showcasing the capabilities of the studios.

- There is a lot of information on this website for the user.

- The equipment information is extensive.

<img src="/media/readme-images/pirate-pro-1.png" width="50%" alt="Homepage Wireframe" style="display: inherit; ">

- The booking system is effective and works well.

<img src="/media/readme-images/pirate-pro-2.png" width="50%" alt="Homepage Wireframe" style="display: inherit; ">

Con's

- The images and styling of the site are not very professional.

<img src="/media/readme-images/pirate-con.png" width="50%" alt="Homepage Wireframe" style="display: inherit; ">

- The links don't have hover qualities, and some don't change the cursor to a pointer, so it's not certain what you are clicking on.

- The use of colour is very strange. Most of the text areas are black and white, and then there are rendom areas of the site with completely random colours thrown in, no scheme at all.

- Really long events and workshops page, no back to top button.

- Navbar is very complicated, there are way too many subchoices.

#### Robannas Studios Birmingham

[Robannas Studios Birmingham](https://www.robannas-studios.co.uk/) is located on Cliveland St, Birmingham.

Pro's

- They have a meet the team section which is friendly looking.

- They have a section explaining some of the celebrities they've worked with, which adds to their credibility.

- Lots of information on really cool looking previous projects.

Con's

- The first thing I noticed is the navbar and header are not responsive. This is the same with every element throughout the site.

<img src="/media/readme-images/robannas-con-1.png" width="50%" alt="Homepage Wireframe" style="display: inherit; ">

- The use of colours and the image of the girls make the website seem on first impression to be for kids, it;'s not very professional for a recording studio to have parties.

- The footer information is off-screen.
- None of the links have hover attributes.

- Random social links to the right of the navbar.

- Some of the navbar links take you to a completely different site without warning.
